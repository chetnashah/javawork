## LinkedList

LinkedList is a doubly linked list.

Doubly-linked list implementation of the `List` and `Deque` interfaces. 
Implements all optional list operations, and permits all elements (including null).

All of the operations perform as could be expected for a doubly-linked list. Operations that index into the list will traverse the list from the beginning or the end, whichever is closer to the specified index.
