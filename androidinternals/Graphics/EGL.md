**EGL™ is an interface between Khronos rendering APIs such as OpenGL ES or OpenVG and the underlying native platform window system.**

It handles graphics context management, surface/buffer binding, and rendering synchronization and enables high-performance, accelerated, mixed-mode 2D and 3D rendering using other Khronos APIs. 

EGL also provides interop capability between Khronos to enable efficient transfer of data between APIs – for example between a video subsystem running OpenMAX AL and a GPU running OpenGL ES.
