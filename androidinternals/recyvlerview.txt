------------------------ ViewGroup --------------------------
Understanding detaching vs removing in ViewGroup :

detach : detaching should only be temporary and reattachment or
removal should happen within same drawing cycle as detachment
When a view is detached, its parent link is null and it 
cannot be retrieved by a call to getChildAt(int), 
All detach methods only call removeFromArray(index), and notification/onDetached methods on child are not called.

attach :  Attaches a view to viewgroup. Attaching a view
assigns viewgroup as parent and sets layout params and
puts view in list mChildren so that it can be retrieved using
getChildrenAt(int)

removeDetachedView(View child) : Finishes removal of detached view.
this will trigger child.dispatchDetachedFromWindow. This is the actual point when detachedfromwindow is called on the child view.

All addView methods lead to addViewInner.

In a viewgroup, addViewInner sets up child's mParent to this,
and removeFromArray, sets child's mParent = null.
attachViewToParent also sets up childs mParent to this.

------------------------------- RecyclerView -------------------
The primary class of interaction is viewholder which is a static nested class.
RecyclerView Layoutparams is also a static nested class.

Recyclerview primarily deals in terms of viewholder

Adapter is the primary generator of views for the first time. via oncreateViewHolder.
The viewholder recieves the itemView from the first time from onCreateViewHolder method of the adapter.

there is this cyclic chanin of references, where all of the three can be reached from each other. 
ViewHolder <-> ItemView <-> LayoutParams.
itemView.getLayoutParams() // public
layoutParams.mViewHolder // package private property
viewHolder.itemView // public

Scrap views vs recycled views : 
Scrap views and recycled views both indicate views that may be dirty and can be reusd with/without binding, difference being, scrap views may still be attached
to parent recyclerview, where as recycled views are mostly not attached to the parent recyclerview, but only just initialized templates (saving time on inflation).

getViewForPosition :
primary API for outside world to get views for a particular position.
At the end of this call, the view would have been properly allocated, bound with
correct data as per position. Note, they may or maynot have been added to 
the recyclerview yet.
It looks for view in scrap by position.
 If not found , look for scrap by Id, If it has stableIds
If not found in scrap, take a garbage templateview from recycler pool.
If nothing was available from recycler pool, ask adapter to make viewholder via
oncreate viewholder.
No matter where the viewholder came from in above, it will be bound using bindviewholder.
Setup layoutparams to point to the viewholder and return holder.itemView

scrapping :
Viewholder has a private variable :
Recycler mScrapContainer , which if non null means itemView is currently
considered scrap.
Calling scrapView(itemView) will set this above variable.
and calling unscrapView(vh) will make it null.

public apis on LayoutManager:
addView(view)
attachView(view)
detachView(view)
removeView(view) - remove parent child relation ship between recyclerview and view. This should be followed by recycleView(view) in order to put view into the pool
