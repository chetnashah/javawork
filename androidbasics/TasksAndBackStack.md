## TAsk

A task is a stack of activities.
When all activities are removed from the stack, the task no longer exists.



## Home behavior

When a user touches the icon for an app or shortcut in the app launcher (or on the Home screen), that app's task comes to the foreground. 

If no task exists for the app (the app has not been used recently), then a new task is created and the main activity for that app opens as the root activity in the stack.


## Recents behavior

The Recents screen (also referred to as the Overview screen, recent task list, or recent apps) is a system-level UI that lists recently accessed activities and tasks. 

The user can navigate through the list and select a task to resume, or the user can remove a task from the list by swiping it away
