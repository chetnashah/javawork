### Include prebuilt native libraries

If you want Gradle to package prebuilt native libraries that are not used in any external native build, add them to the `src/main/jniLibs/ABI` directory of your module.


### where .so files should be put or generated by default, here is a summary:


`libs/CPU_ABI` inside an eclipse project

`jniLibs/CPU_ABI` inside an Android Studio project

`jni/CPU_ABI` inside an AAR

`lib/CPU_ABI` inside the final APK

inside the app's `nativeLibraryPath` on a <5.0 device, and inside the app's `legacyNativeLibraryDir/CPU_ARCH` on a >=5.0 device.

Where CPU_ABI is any of: `armeabi, armeabi-v7a, arm64-v8a, x86, x86_64, mips, mips64`. Depending on which architectures you're targeting and your libs have been compiled for.
