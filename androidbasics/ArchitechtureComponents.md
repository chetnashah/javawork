## UI layer

https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture/ui-layer
The UI layer that displays application data on the screen. Effectively, the UI is a visual representation of the application state as retrieved from the data layer.
The UI layer is the pipeline that converts application data changes to a form that the UI can present and then displays.

The UI layer is made up of two things:

1. UI elements that render the data on the screen. You build these elements using Views or Jetpack Compose functions.
2. State holders (such as `ViewModel` classes) that hold data, expose it to the UI, and handle logic.

### UiState

UiState - UI state is an immutable snapshot of the details needed for the UI to render.
```kt
data class LoginUiState(
    val isLoading: Boolean = false,
    val errorMessage: String? = null,
    val isUserLoggedIn: Boolean = false
)
```

or 
```kt
data class NewsUiState(
    val isSignedIn: Boolean = false,
    val isPremium: Boolean = false,
    val newsItems: List<NewsItemUiState> = listOf(),
    val userMessages: List<Message> = listOf()
)
```

### State holders

The classes that are `responsible for the production of UI state` and contain the necessary logic for that task are called state holders.

Use `ViewModel`: The `ViewModel` type is the recommended implementation for the management of screen-level UI state with access to the data layer.

## Data Layer

The data layer of an app contains the business logic. The business logic is what gives value to your appâ€”it's made of rules that determine how your app creates, stores, and changes data.

**The data layer is made of `repositories` that each can contain zero to many data sources.** 

You should create a repository class for each different type of data you handle in your app. For example, you might create a MoviesRepository class for data related to movies, or a PaymentsRepository class for data related to payments.

Repository classes are responsible for the following tasks:

* Exposing data to the rest of the app.
* Centralizing changes to the data.
* Resolving conflicts between multiple data sources.
* Abstracting sources of data from the rest of the app.
* Containing business logic.
