## String resources with formatting

string resources with format arguments. For example, the subtotal and total price strings that you're using in the app are declared as

```xml
<string name="subtotal_price">Subtotal %s</string>
<string name="total_price">Total %s</string>
```

where `%s` is a placeholder for the formatted price string.
