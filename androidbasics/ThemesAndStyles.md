## Style

A style can specify attributes for a View, such as font color, font size, background color, and much more.


## Theme

A theme is a collection of styles that's applied to an entire app, activity, or view hierarchyâ€”not just an individual View.

When you apply a theme to an app, activity, view, or view group, the theme is applied to that element and all of its children. Themes can also apply styles to non-view elements, such as the status bar and window background

### Theme colors

1. primary - 
2. secondary -
3. surface - cards, sheets menus
4. background - behind scrollable content
5. error - errors in components such as text fields

"On colors" - Whenever other screen elements, such as **text or icons**, appear in front of surfaces using those colors, those elements should use colors specifically designed to appear clearly and legibly against the colors behind them. Usually **on-colors will be opposite to their background provide contrast**.

e.g.
6. on-primary
7. on-secondary
8. on-background
9. on-surface
10. on-error
