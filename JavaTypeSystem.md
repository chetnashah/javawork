### Type erasure of generics

During the type erasure process, the Java compiler erases all type parameters and replaces each with its first bound if the type parameter is bounded, or Object if the type parameter is unbounded.

Consider the following generic class that represents a node in a singly linked list:
```java
public class Node<T> {

    private T data;
    private Node<T> next;

    public Node(T data, Node<T> next) {
        this.data = data;
        this.next = next;
    }

    public T getData() { return data; }
    // ...
}
```
Because the type parameter `T` is unbounded, the Java compiler replaces it with Object:
```java
public class Node {

    private Object data;
    private Node next;

    public Node(Object data, Node next) {
        this.data = data;
        this.next = next;
    }

    public Object getData() { return data; }
    // ...
}
```

### Reifiable types
A reifiable type is a type whose type information is fully available at runtime. This includes `primitives`, `non-generic types`, `raw types`, and `invocations of unbound wildcards`.

### Non-reifiable types

Non-reifiable types are types where information has been removed at compile-time by type erasure â€” invocations of generic types that are not defined as unbounded wildcards. A non-reifiable type does not have all of its information available at runtime. Examples of non-reifiable types are `List<String>` and `List<Number>`; the JVM cannot tell the difference between these types at runtime. As shown in Restrictions on Generics, there are certain situations where non-reifiable types cannot be used: in an instanceof expression, for example, or as an element in an array.

### Effect of type erasure and bridge methods

Sometimes type erasure causes a situation that you may not have anticipated. The following example shows how this can occur. The following example shows how a compiler sometimes creates a synthetic method, which is called a bridge method, as part of the type erasure process.

Given the following two classes:
```java
public class Node<T> {

    public T data;

    public Node(T data) { this.data = data; }

    public void setData(T data) {
        System.out.println("Node.setData");
        this.data = data;
    }
}

public class MyNode extends Node<Integer> {
    public MyNode(Integer data) { super(data); }

    public void setData(Integer data) {
        System.out.println("MyNode.setData");
        super.setData(data);
    }
}
```
Consider the following code:
```java
MyNode mn = new MyNode(5);
Node n = mn;            // A raw type - compiler throws an unchecked warning
n.setData("Hello");     // Causes a ClassCastException to be thrown.
Integer x = mn.data;    
```
After type erasure, this code becomes:
```java
MyNode mn = new MyNode(5);
Node n = mn;            // A raw type - compiler throws an unchecked warning
                        // Note: This statement could instead be the following:
                        //     Node n = (Node)mn;
                        // However, the compiler doesn't generate a cast because
                        // it isn't required.
n.setData("Hello");     // Causes a ClassCastException to be thrown.
Integer x = (Integer)mn.data; 
The next section explains why a ClassCastException is thrown at the n.setData("Hello"); statement.
```

### Bridge methods

When compiling a class or interface that extends a parameterized class or implements a parameterized interface, the compiler may need to create a synthetic method, which is called a bridge method, as part of the type erasure process. You normally don't need to worry about bridge methods, but you might be puzzled if one appears in a stack trace.

After type erasure, the Node and MyNode classes become:
```java
public class Node {

    public Object data;

    public Node(Object data) { this.data = data; }

    public void setData(Object data) {
        System.out.println("Node.setData");
        this.data = data;
    }
}

public class MyNode extends Node {

    public MyNode(Integer data) { super(data); }

    public void setData(Integer data) {
        System.out.println("MyNode.setData");
        super.setData(data);
    }
}
```
After type erasure, the method signatures do not match; the `Node.setData(T)` method becomes `Node.setData(Object)`. As a result, the `MyNode.setData(Integer)` method does not override the `Node.setData(Object)` method.

To solve this problem and preserve the polymorphism of generic types after type erasure, the Java compiler generates a bridge method to ensure that subtyping works as expected.

For the MyNode class, the compiler generates the following bridge method for setData:
```java
class MyNode extends Node {

    // Bridge method generated by the compiler
    //
    public void setData(Object data) {
        setData((Integer) data);
    }

    public void setData(Integer data) {
        System.out.println("MyNode.setData");
        super.setData(data);
    }

    // ...
}
```
The bridge method `MyNode.setData(object)` delegates to the original `MyNode.setData(Integer)` method. As a result, the `n.setData("Hello");` statement calls the method `MyNode.setData(Object)`, and a `ClassCastException` is thrown because "Hello" can't be cast to Integer.
