## Methods

Interfaces in Kotlin can **contain declarations of abstract methods, as well as method implementations**. What makes them different from abstract classes is that **interfaces cannot store a state (non-abstract properties and backing fields)**. 
## Properties

They can have properties, but these **need to be abstract or provide accessor implementations**
