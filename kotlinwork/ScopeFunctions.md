Five types:

1.`with`
2. `run`
3. `let`
4. `apply`
5. `also`



## why scope functions?

Execute a block of code within scope of an object.
When you call such a function on an object with a lambda expression provided, 
it forms a temporary scope. 

In this scope, you can access the object without its name.
