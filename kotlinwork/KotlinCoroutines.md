## 
* A suspendable computation.
* Not bound to any particular thread. It may suspend its execution on one thread and resume on another.
* multiple coroutines can concurrently run on a single thread,
* very cheap
* Different continuations of a same coroutine might be scheduled on different threads.

## DEbugging coroutines on android

```kotlin
class MainApplication: Application() {
    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()
        System.setProperty("kotlinx.coroutines.debug", "on" )
    }
}
```

## Starting coroutine



## Coroutines launched on Globalscope do not keep the process alive
Active coroutines launched in GlobalScope do not keep the process alive. 
They are like daemon.

A process can be killed before Globalscope.launch ed coroutine gets a chance to run.
e.g.
```kotlin
fun main(){
    println("Main running! from thread name = ${Thread.currentThread().name}")
    GlobalScope.launch {// does not keep application alive/running
        println("Running inside a launched coroutine")
    }
}
```

## By defaulted coroutines are run in non-main threads (E.g. DefaultDispatcher-worker-1)

See example:
```kotlin
fun main(){
    println("Main running! from thread name = ${Thread.currentThread().name}")
    // creates and runs coroutine on a background thread
    GlobalScope.launch {// does not keep application alive/running
        println("fake work inside a launched coroutine, current thread = ${Thread.currentThread().name}") //DefaultDispatcher-worker-1 
    }
    Thread.sleep(1000) // giving coroutine a chance to run
}
```
## suspend keyword

marks a function as suspendable.
**A suspendable/suspending function is only allowed to be called from a coroutine or from another suspending function.**

The `suspend` modifier indicates that this is a function that can suspend the execution of a coroutine by calling a library suspend function like `delay`, `yeild`.

## suspending lambda

A lambda that might be using a suspending function.
Type signature looks like this: `suspend () -> Unit`

## Suspension point

A suspension point â€” is a point during coroutine execution where the execution of the coroutine may be suspended. Syntactically, a suspension point is an invocation of suspending function, but the actual suspension happens when the suspending function invokes the standard library primitive to suspend the execution.


## Continuation

A fancy name for a generic callback. 
State of suspended coroutine at the suspension point. You can think of it as remaining code after suspension point.
It conceptually represents the rest of its execution after the suspension point.

Interace definition:
```kotlin
interface Continuation<in T> {
   val context: CoroutineContext
   fun resumeWith(result: Result<T>) // equivalent to resolve in a promise constructor
   fun resumeWithException() // equivalent to reject in a promise constructor
}
```

`resumeWith`: The `resumeWith` function is a completion callback that is used to report either a success (with a value) or a failure (with an exception) on coroutine completion.

## `.await()` extension function on Futures

Only available via following gradle dependency:
`kotlinx-coroutines-jdk8`, in package: `import kotlinx.coroutines.future.await`

```kotlin
        var f = CompletableFuture.completedFuture(11)
        var ans = f.await()
        println("\nF = $ans")
```

### ContinuationInterceptor

It is a `CoroutineContext.Element`.
Interface definition:
```kotlin
interface ContinuationInterceptor : CoroutineContext.Element {
    fun <T> interceptContinuation(continuation: Continuation<T>): Continuation<T>
}
```

## coroutine builders

To create and start a new coroutine we use one of the main "coroutine builders".

All coroutine builders are regular functions, that take a `context` and a `block: suspend () -> ?` i.e. a suspending lambda.

1. `runBlocking` - runs/blocks coroutine on thread in which it is specified. It will block the hosting thread until the coroutine is done. It is designed to bridge regular blocking code to libraries that are written in suspending style, to be used in main functions and in tests. when this run-blocking block starts, it will even stop/block other half run/suspended coroutines that were launched on this thread from executing
2. `async` - takes a suspending lambda returns a `Deferred<Result>` which is same as a Promise/Future. You can call `.await()` on a deferred object e.g. `deferred1.await()`.
3. `launch` - Fire and forget, non-blocking in nature, as it runs coroutine in separate thread than where it is specified.
4. `future` - returns a CompletableFuture.

All coroutine builders take a lambda in which `this` is set to coroutineScope
### CoroutineContext

Coroutine context is a persistent set of user-defined objects that can be attached to the coroutine. 

It may include objects responsible for coroutine threading policy, logging, security and transaction aspects of the coroutine execution, coroutine identity and name, etc. Here is the simple mental model of coroutines and their contexts. 

Think of a coroutine as a light-weight thread. In this case, coroutine context is just like a collection of thread-local variables. The difference is that thread-local variables are mutable, while coroutine context is immutable, which is not a serious limitation for coroutines, because they are so light-weight that it is easy to launch a new coroutine when there is a need to change anything in the context.


Coroutines always execute in some context represented by a value of `CoroutineContext type`.

#### CoroutineContext.Element

An `Element` of the coroutine context is a context itself. 
It is a singleton context with this element only. 

This enables creation of composite contexts by taking library definitions of coroutine context elements and joining them with +. For example, if one library defines auth element with user authorization information, and some other library defines threadPool object with some execution context information, then you can use a `launch{}` coroutine builder with the combined context using `launch(auth + threadPool) {...}` invocation.

### suspendCoroutine

```kotlin
suspend fun <T> suspendCoroutine(block: (Continuation<T>) -> Unit): T
```
Takes a normal callback function and turns it into a suspending lambda.

When `suspendCoroutine` is called inside a coroutine (and it can only be called inside a coroutine, because it is a suspending function) it captures the execution state of a coroutine in a continuation instance and passes this continuation to the specified block as an argument. 

To resume execution of the coroutine, the block invokes `continuation.resumeWith()` (either directly or using `continuation.resume()` or `continuation.resumeWithException()` extensions) in this thread or in some other thread at some later time. 

**The actual suspension of a coroutine happens when the suspendCoroutine block returns without invoking resumeWith**

e.g. usage
```kotlin
suspend fun <T> CompletableFuture<T>.await(): T = // extension function on Completablefuture
    suspendCoroutine<T> { cont: Continuation<T> ->
        whenComplete { result, exception -> // whenComplete is a part of Future API
            if (exception == null) // the future has been completed normally
                cont.resume(result) // resolve
            else // the future has completed with an exception
                cont.resumeWithException(exception) // reject
        }
    }
```

Another example is `Call` which is a Future available from Retrofit library
```kotlin
suspend fun <T> Call<T>.await(): T = // extension function on Completablefuture
    suspendCoroutine<T> { cont: Continuation<T> ->
        enqueue(object: Callback<T>{
            override fun onResponse(call: Call<T>, response: Response<T>){
                if(response.isSuccessful) {
                    cont.resume(response.body)
                } else {
                    cont.resumeWithException(ErrorResponse(response))
                }
            }
            overrid fun onFailure(call: Call<T>, t: Throwable) {
                cont.resumeWithException(t)
            }
        })
    }
```

### startCoroutine

It is like a complement to suspendCoroutine.
e.g.
`block.startCoroutine(completionContinuation)` where
It is a method available on suspending lambda e.g.
```kotlin
fun <T> (suspend () -> T).startCoroutine(
    completion: Continuation<T>)
```

Starts a coroutine without a receiver and with result type `T`. 

This function creates and starts a new, fresh instance of suspendable computation every time it is invoked. 
The completion continuation is invoked when the coroutine completes with a result or an exception. basically completion continuation you can specify what to do after `block` finishes, by providing an anonymous object extending Continuation interface.





### CoroutineScope

Scope decides lifetime in which a coroutine is valid. Every coroutine needs to run in a scope. 
Coroutine scope is responsible for the structure and parent-child relationships between different coroutines. We always start new coroutines inside a scope.
CoroutineScope is a place where execution can be suspended.

Every `coroutine builder`, e.g. `launch`, `async` is an extension of `CoroutineScope` and automatically inherits its `coroutineContext` to automatically propogate all its elements and cancellation.

When `launch`, `async`, or `runBlocking` are used to create and start a new coroutine, they automatically create the corresponding scope.
For `launch`/`async` that are not run using `GlobalScope`, they will use the
context like thread to run and other things from parent coroutinescope.

`CoroutineScope interace`: see below
It is present inside `this` argument of any suspending lambda given to coroutine builders. So for e.g.
```kt
public interface CoroutineScope {
    /**
     * The context of this scope.
     * Context is encapsulated by the scope and used for implementation of coroutine builders that are extensions on the scope.
     * Accessing this property in general code is not recommended for any purposes except accessing the [Job] instance for advanced usages.
     *
     * By convention, should contain an instance of a [job][Job] to enforce structured concurrency.
     */
    public val coroutineContext: CoroutineContext
}
```

Interesting extra methods on `CoroutineScope Interface` (as extension functions):
1. `launch`
2.  `async`
3. `plus`
4. `isActive`
5. `cancel`
6. `ensureActive`

`CoroutineScope function (not interface)`: Creates a coroutineScope that wraps a given coroutine context. If the given context does not containa `Job` element, a default `Job()` is created.
```kt
public fun CoroutineScope(context: CoroutineContext): CoroutineScope =
    ContextScope(if (context[Job] != null) context else context + Job())
```

`coroutineScope function` suspend function, takes a suspending lambda and creates a CoroutineScope, inheriting coroutineContext from outer scope.
```kt
public suspend fun <R> coroutineScope(block: suspend CoroutineScope.() -> R): R {
    contract {
        callsInPlace(block, InvocationKind.EXACTLY_ONCE)
    }
    return suspendCoroutineUninterceptedOrReturn { uCont ->
        val coroutine = ScopeCoroutine(uCont.context, uCont)
        coroutine.startUndispatchedOrReturn(coroutine, block)
    }
}
```
Example usage:
```kt
suspend fun showSomeData() = coroutineScope {
    val data = async(Dispatchers.IO) { // <- extension on current scope
     ... load some UI data for the Main thread ...
    }

    withContext(Dispatchers.Main) {
        doSomeWork()
        val result = data.await()
        display(result)
    }
}
```

`GlobalScope`: top level scope, coroutines launched via `GlobalScope.launch { }` are top level coroutines that can survive entire life span of an application.

Implementation of GlobalScope:
```kt
public object GlobalScope : CoroutineScope {
    /**
     * Returns [EmptyCoroutineContext].
     */
    override val coroutineContext: CoroutineContext
        get() = EmptyCoroutineContext
}
```

`MainScope`: The resulting scope has SupervisorJob and Dispatchers.Main context elements.

```kt
public fun MainScope(): CoroutineScope = ContextScope(SupervisorJob() + Dispatchers.Main)
```
Android provides:
1. `lifecycleScope`:
2. `viewModelScope`:

### ContextScope

Given a CoroutineContext, create a CoroutineScope with sensible defaults.
```kt
internal class ContextScope(context: CoroutineContext) : CoroutineScope {
    override val coroutineContext: CoroutineContext = context
    // CoroutineScope is used intentionally for user-friendly representation
    override fun toString(): String = "CoroutineScope(coroutineContext=$coroutineContext)"
}
```

### Dispatchers

Base class to be extended by all coroutine dispatcher implementations.
`determines what thread` or threads the corresponding coroutine uses for its execution. 
The coroutine dispatcher can confine coroutine execution to a specific thread, dispatch it to a thread pool, or let it run unconfined.

**All coroutine builders like `launch` and `async` accept an optional CoroutineContext parameter that can be used to explicitly specify the dispatcher for the new coroutine**

Three types:
1. `Dispatchers.Default`: Shared background pool of threads
2. `Dispatchers.IO`: uses a shared thread pool of ondemand created threads and is designed for offloading of IO intensive blocking operations.
3. `Dispatchers.Unconfined`:

e.g.
```kotlin
launch(Dispatchers.Unconfined) { // not confined -- will work with main thread
    println("Unconfined            : I'm working in thread ${Thread.currentThread().name}")
}
launch(Dispatchers.Default) { // will get dispatched to DefaultDispatcher 
    println("Default               : I'm working in thread ${Thread.currentThread().name}")
}
launch(newSingleThreadContext("MyOwnThread")) { // will get its own new thread
    println("newSingleThreadContext: I'm working in thread ${Thread.currentThread().name}")
}
```

The default dispatcher is used when no other dispatcher is explicitly specified in the scope. It is represented by Dispatchers.Default and uses a shared background pool of threads.

In order to work with the Main dispatcher, the following artifact should be added to the project runtime dependencies:

`kotlinx-coroutines-android` â€” for Android Main thread dispatcher
`kotlinx-coroutines-javafx` â€” for JavaFx Application thread dispatcher
`kotlinx-coroutines-swing` â€” for Swing EDT dispatcher



### runBlocking

It is designed to bridge regular blocking code to libraries that are written in suspending style, to be used in main functions and in tests.

**It runs coroutine in the same thread where it is specified** (e.g. here in the example in main thread). All code after this block does not get a chance to run till this block/job is finished

when this run-blocking block starts, it will even stop/block other half run/suspended coroutines that were launched on this thread from executing.

```kotlin
fun main(){
    println("hello ")
    runBlocking {
        println("fake work by coroutine is done inside thread - ${Thread.currentThread().name}") // runs on main thread
        delay(10000)
    } // code after this line does not get executed and is blocked till above coroutine-job finishes. 
}
```

### launch

`launch` is a coroutine builder, it cannot be used directly but needs a scope in order to be used. It is an extension function on `CoroutineScope` object.
launch is used for starting a computation that isn't expected to return a specific result. launch returns `Job`, which represents the coroutine. 

It is possible to wait until it completes by calling `Job.join()`.
It launches a new coroutine concurrently with the rest of code.


### async

async starts a new coroutine and returns a Deferred object. Cannot be directly used at toplevel, needs to be declared in a scope.
Think of `async` as `launch`, but with a Deferred result to be returned.
Runs as soon as specified,
`Deferred` extends `JOb`, but also has extra methods like `.await()`.

### delay

special suspending function, `suspending does not block the thread`.
similar to yeilding.
Code occuring after `delay` might be scheduled on a separate thread thread compared to the code before `delay`.

Since `delay` is a suspendable function, it can be only called inside a coroutine or other suspending functions.

You can think of this as similar to how await is only allowed to be called inside async functions in javascript.

## Structured concurrency

Parent always waits for children completion

### Resource cleanup

* never loose a working coroutine
### Error propogation

* Never loose an exception


## Job

To better manage a coroutine, a `job` is provided when we `launch` or `async`.
A `job` is part of context of the coroutine. It is kind of like a handle to the coroutine.

A `Job` represents a coroutine or task that is being performed.
A `Job` is a `CoroutineContext.Element`.
i.e.
```kotlin
interface Job : CoroutineContext.Element {
    companion object key : CoroutineContext.Key<Job>
}
```

A `CoroutineContext` is a collection of different couroutine context elements.
`Deferred` is also a `Job` so it can be cancelled if needed.

API:
1. `job.join()`: wherever declared, it will suspend execution till the specified job is finished, and resume execution post that.
e.g.
```kt
fun main() = runBlocking {
    println("main prog starts")
    val job = launch {
        println(" fake work starts")
        delay(1000)
        println(" fake work ends)
    }
    job.join()
    println("main prog ends")
}
```

2. `job.cancel()`: 

## CPS transformation of suspending functions

```kotlin
suspend fun createPost(token: Token, item: Item): Post { ... }
```

gets converted to JVM side as:
```java
Object createPost(Token token, Item item, Continuation<Post> cont)
```

In detail this is done through state machines

## Coroutines on android

```groovy
implementation 'org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-android:1.0.0'
```


* get Access to `Main` Dispatcher
